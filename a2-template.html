  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    The Data set used was a cleaned version of assignment 1's data set<br/>
    The data set gives insight into DFW rates of all students from F17 - S22. The cleaned version is a much simpler version to use for application like tableau.
    This data was produced by Sacramento State University and was cleaned by Muhammad Ahmed.
    We are interested in this data because it gives us insight into how covid has affected the DFW rates of students in the ECS department.

    The data is available online at:

      <br/>
      Question: What were the DFW rates of ECS students before covid?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For my question I got, what is the DFW rates of ECS students before covid, F17-F19. 
      In my chart you can see a lot of similar trends between the ECS department. Mechanical 
      Engineering is the only outlier. In most of the major there is a trend moving up. The rates 
      for most majors always increase between F17 to F18. And tend to stay there with an upwards projection. 
      You would need more semesters to finalize this conclusion, but it seen to look that way when zooming out and in different models.

      <br/> 
      <br/>
      Question: What were the DFW rates of ECS students during covid?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Interpretation: The DFW rates are clearly displayed in the bar graph for each ECS department, it greatly 
      contrasts the DFW rates in the before and after covid bar graphs. We can see the significant decrease in DFW 
      rates for these 2 semesters during the initial covid obsersved year. A better view and contrast of these DFW rates would be a full range of semesters,
      but that would be too much data to display in a single graph causing clutter and confusion for the viewer.

      Question: What were the DFW Rates of ECS Students After Covid, S21 - S22, at CSUS?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Interpretation: The graph doesn't show a significant increase or decrease in the DFW rates of ECS students 
      after Covid for most of the departments. The only department that exhibits a significant decrease in DFW rates is Engineering. 
      The Computer Science department experienced a slight increase in the DFW rates in the Spring of 2022.

      Cameron Ingersoll - Number of classes not being offered in the ECS College F17 - S22
      <br/> 
      <br/>
      Question: What were the number of classes not being offered in the ECS College at CSUS?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Interpretation: My visualization describes how many classes were not offered in the entire ECS college.
      By showing the amount of classes that are not offered we can imply the amount of classes
      that are being offered is decreasing over the course of Fall 2017 to Spring 2022 for the
      entire ECS college. I thought it was surprising to learn that the classes were actually
      decreasing over the pandemic instead of increasing. The main focus of this visualization
      is to show the amount of classes overall and they are decreasing at a surprisingly high rate.

      Eric Plocher - Average Enrollement
      <br/> 
      <br/>
      Question: How did covid impact average total enrollment within the ECS department at CSUS?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Interpretation: The bar graph plot appears to show no indication of a sharp rise or decrease in enrollment among the ECS 
      department at CSUS due resulting from the covid pandemic. While some classes like computer science may have seen a dramatic 
      rise in enrollment throughout the timeline, on average many of the departments saw a gradual increase or decrease, resulting 
      in an assumption that Covid had very little impact on the total enrollment within the ECS department.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the lessons learned are based on choosing data wisely and using it efficiently to convey an answer to the questions at hand. 
      We all decided to use bar graphs as we all agreed it is the easiest to read when trying to convey a message using the data. 
      The only concerns we seemed to have at times was being able to answer the covid questions rates with only the range given as 
      data is best interpreted with more data and the whole range included. Our best answer to this was sticking with the individual 
      graph ranges to be interpreted and analyzed separately.
